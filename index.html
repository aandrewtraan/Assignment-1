      <h2>Personal Information</h2>
      <p>I was born in Australia but my parents were born in Vietnam. In my household, we speak both English and Vietnamese.</p>

      <p>I went to Overnewton for prep, Emmaus Catholic Primary School from Year 1 to 6, Catholic Regional College (CRC) North Keilor from Year 7 to 10, and CRC Sydenham from Year 11 to 12.</p>

      <p>One interesting fact about me is that I have managed to build my own relatively high-end PC by myself if you don’t include the YouTube tutorial I used.</p>

      <h2>Interest in IT</h2>

      <h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
      <p>I’m interested in IT because I’m interested in the growing technology in today’s world. I find it fascinating how technology can be used for literally anything and everything to make our lives just so much easier and more convenient than ever. My interest started really young and has continued to this day.</p>

      <h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
      <p>This interest all started when I was young and had just gotten my first laptop. I used to play games such as Minecraft and Roblox with my cousin all the time. The laptop we both had were MacBooks so we also had a lot of fun using Photobooth to record random videos and take hilariously filtered photos. It wasn’t until my mum got my first pc that I got more into gaming. That PC lasted for over six or seven years (honestly I can’t remember since I’ve had it for so long) until 2021 when it finally died. I’m pretty sure it was repairable but at that point I might as well get a new pc since all the parts were so old and outdated. I pursued my interest in IT in Year 11 and 12 where I enrolled in courses such as VET IT, Software Development and Data Analytics.</p>

      <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
      <p>I chose to come to RMIT because I heard many good things about this university and its expertise in technology. Additionally, RMIT is conveniently located in a place that I can easily travel to without too much of a hassle.</p>

      <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
      <p>I expect to learn everything needed to get me into a job relating to IT. Not only will I learn the ‘nerdy’ things such as coding, but other vital aspects of IT like security and data management.</p>

        <div class="columns">
          <h4>Analytical</h4>
          <p>Logicians analyse everything that they come by. This gives them a talent for noticing unexpected patterns and connections that other personality types may miss.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="columns">
          <h4>Original</h4>
          <p>Logicians are creative due to their imagination and can come up with unique ideas that most people wouldn't think of. Although, many of these ideas may not be practical.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="columns">
          <h4>Open-Minded</h4>
          <p>Logicians are curious in nature and wish to learn everything that they can. They're always interested in new ideas and different ways of doing things as long as those ideas are supported by proper logic and reason.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="columns">
          <h4>Objective</h4>
          <p>Logicians care about the truth and reality. Instead of ideologies and hypothetical ideas, they prefer to understand what is actually going on. Therefore they aren't affected by bias and misinformation.</p>

      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <hr>
      <div class="attributes">
        <div class="columns">
          <h4>Disconnected</h4>
          <p> Logicians tend to get lost in their own thoughts, even when surrounded by others. A conversation may have already moved to the next topic by the time they find what they want to say. This may cause them to feel detached from other people, especially in large social gatherings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="columns">
          <h4>Insensitive</h4>
          <p> Logicians see rationality as the key to a better world. This means that they may forget the importance of the irrational values such as: emotion, compassion and tradition. Due to this, they may accidentally come across as insensitive or unkind, even though their intentions are generally good.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="columns">
          <h4>Dissatisfied</h4>
          <p>Logicians can’t help but strive to believe that things can be further improved. They are always searching for problems to solve and things to learn. But this mindset can become overwhelming, and at some point they may focus too hard on bettering themselves that they can forget their own basic needs and responsibilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="columns">
          <h4>Perfectionist</h4>
          <p>Logicians want to get things done, but their constant aim for perfection can hinder this. Occasionally, they may get so lost in overthinking various options that they never manage to reach a final decision. They may also give up on projects that don’t match the ideal vision in their mind.</p>
